## About The Project

![MocaPort Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/aBcDeFg.png)

MocaPort is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Moca Network that addresses two of the most critical challenges in Web3: **Sybil attacks** and **fragmented digital identity**.  
It functions as a universal passport for the digital world, empowering users to aggregate their Web2 and Web3 credentials into a single, privacy-preserving **Moca ID**.

By leveraging the advanced capabilities of the Moca Network, MocaPort provides a robust on-chain reputation system. This allows other dApps and protocols within the Mocaverse to verify user uniqueness and engagement without compromising personal data, enabling **fair airdrops, weighted governance, and trust-minimized applications**.

Our core mission is to deliver a **frictionless, Web2-like user experience** that abstracts away the complexities of blockchain, making decentralized identity accessible to the next billion users.

## Key Features

MocaPort is designed to be a cornerstone of the Mocaverse, demonstrating the full power of the Moca Network's identity stack:

- **Frictionless Onboarding**: Utilizes Moca's Account Abstraction for seamless social logins (Google, X, etc.). No seed phrases, no browser extensions—just a familiar, one-click experience.  
- **Universal Identity Passport**: Collect verifiable credentials, or "stamps," from both Web2 and Web3 sources to build a comprehensive on-chain resume.  
- **Privacy-Preserving Verification**: Built with Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), allowing users to prove claims (e.g., "I am a verified NFT holder") without revealing sensitive underlying data.  
- **Trustless Web2 Data Integration**: Uses zkTLS technology to securely import and verify a user's activity from platforms like GitHub and Twitter, bridging reputation into Web3.  
- **Dynamic On-Chain Reputation**: Generates a composable reputation score based on collected credentials, anchored on the Moca Chain for public verifiability.  
- **Sybil Resistance**: Provides dApps with tools to query MocaPort scores or specific credentials, ensuring rewards and governance rights go to unique, real users.
